# WaterSplash
Water splash node 2D for Godot game engine I wrote for my indie game LittleShadows. 
To use it, just clone in into your godot branch module directory and recompile godot (as explained here http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/reference/custom_modules_in_c++.html)

Just add a proper texture, adjust the size of the water rectangle and ply a little bit with the parameters to have the effect you like !
